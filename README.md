# all_tamil_nouns

We are working on build a open source spellchecker for Tamil Language using Open-Tamil python library.

We found that we need all the nouns in tamil for quick checking and validating.

It seems our world is full of nouns.

In this repo, we are collecting all the nouns as much possbile.
